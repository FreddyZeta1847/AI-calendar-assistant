# AI Calendar Assistant üìÖ

## Overview

The AI Calendar Assistant is an intelligent WhatsApp bot that simplifies Google Calendar management through natural language processing. Simply send a WhatsApp message describing your event, and the bot will automatically parse the information and create a calendar entry with all the details - including custom colors!

## üéØ Project Scope

This project democratizes calendar management by removing the friction between natural conversation and structured calendar events. Instead of navigating through multiple interfaces and forms, users can simply text their plans as they would to a friend:

- *"Add dinner with Marco tomorrow at 8pm in red"*
- *"Schedule team meeting today at 3:30pm in blue"*
- *"Remind me about yoga class tonight at 6pm in turquoise"*

The bot understands context, interprets dates and times intelligently, and even maps color preferences to Google Calendar's color system.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Stack

### Core Technologies

- **Python 3.10**: Main programming language providing robust backend capabilities
- **Flask**: Lightweight web framework handling webhook endpoints for WhatsApp integration
- **Gunicorn**: Production-grade WSGI server ensuring reliable request handling

### AI & Natural Language Processing

- **OpenAI API (GPT-3.5 Turbo)**: Powers the intelligent text parsing engine that extracts:
  - Event names and descriptions
  - Date and time information (with contextual understanding of "today", "tomorrow", "tonight")
  - Duration calculations
  - Color preferences mapping

### Communication Layer

- **Twilio API**: Bridges WhatsApp with the application through:
  - Webhook integration for receiving messages
  - TwiML responses for sending confirmations
  - Reliable message delivery infrastructure

### Calendar Integration

- **Google Calendar API v3**: Direct integration for event creation
- **Google Service Account**: Enables secure, user-independent calendar access
- **OAuth 2.0 Service Credentials**: Ensures authenticated API calls without user interaction

### Security & Authentication

- **Google Secret Manager**: Secure storage of sensitive credentials
- **Service Account JSON Keys**: Protected authentication for Google services
- **Environment Variables**: Secure configuration management for API keys

### Deployment & Infrastructure

- **Docker**: Containerization for consistent deployment across environments
- **Google Cloud Run / Railway**: Scalable cloud hosting solutions
- **Multi-threaded Processing**: Optimized for concurrent request handling

## üîÑ Application Logic Flow

```
1. User sends WhatsApp message
   ‚Üì
2. Twilio webhook forwards to Flask endpoint
   ‚Üì
3. OpenAI API analyzes text and extracts:
   - Event title
   - Date/time information
   - Description
   - Color preference
   ‚Üì
4. System validates and formats data
   ‚Üì
5. Google Calendar API creates event
   ‚Üì
6. Confirmation sent back via WhatsApp
```

### Intelligent Features

- **Contextual Date Understanding**: Recognizes "today", "tomorrow", "tonight", "this evening"
- **Smart Time Defaults**: Automatically sets 1-hour duration if end time not specified
- **Color Mapping**: Translates natural color names to Google Calendar's 11-color palette
- **Multi-language Support**: Works with Italian and English inputs
- **Error Recovery**: Graceful handling of ambiguous inputs with helpful feedback

## üåç Impact & Vision

This project represents a shift towards more accessible technology, where complex digital tasks become as simple as sending a text message. By removing barriers between intention and action, the AI Calendar Assistant makes digital organization available to everyone, regardless of technical expertise.

The combination of conversational AI and practical utility creates a blueprint for future applications where technology adapts to human communication patterns, rather than forcing users to learn new interfaces. This approach has the potential to revolutionize how we interact with digital services, making them more inclusive, intuitive, and efficient.
